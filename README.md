# Homework research project

One of the objectives of the **homework research project** is to study a little bit in-depth a subject that draws your
attention and interest related to Cloud Computing and Big Data Analytics. It is a common practice in computer science
where professionals regularly need to **increase their knowledge on new topics that they might need to use for their
daily work**.

During the research, you need to be able _to find reliable and trustworthy sources of information_, understand them and
try to invest as much or as little time as necessary to decide whether you are going to spend more time learning about
the subject.

Another of the objectives of this homework assignment is to **cooperate and share your knowledge** with your peers and
help each other to be able to have a broader understanding of Cloud Computing and Big Data Analytics. Therefore, to
focus your research, I would like you to think about the information that you will be sharing from your classmates
perspective _(use the following ideas to center your research focus not like the report index)_:

* What would you like to know about the presented topic to be able to decide if it is worth going in-depth or stop and
  take a different approach?
* What do people say regarding the subject you are studying: is it very successful? Is it mature enough? Do many people
  praise or criticize it?
* What has been your personal experience regarding the subject? What lessons have you learned?
* Share some relevant sources of information to learn more about the topic (URLs of websites, Articles, Blogs, PDF
  files, online courses, etc.)

A final objective of this assignment is to be able to **share the information attractively and concisely**. You can't
expect your audience to invest lots of time on a topic that may not be of interest. Therefore I encourage you to deliver
a short, meaningful, and attractive **tutorial**.

## Instructions to deliver the assigment

For **every team of 5 people**, **three of them** will be preparing a tutorial on a process. It can be something that
they are using for their course project or that they are interested in digging a bit further.

To have more variety on the topics covered, *please contact your teacher before beginning preparing the tutorial*.

The **creators** team members need to add a folder in their project repo named "research" and then
a  `"/research/tutorial/README.md"` file with the explanations, images, pieces of code, etc. similar to the ones used
for your laboratory sessions.

The **validators** team members will be assigned the two tutorials elaborated by the other teams. They will need to
follow the tutorial and submit evidence of their job in `"/research/response1/README.md"`
and `"/research/response2/README.md"` including **feedback for the authors** and **their grade** on how well elaborated
and interesting they find it.

Since each team will only be able to experiment with two assigments the day of the presentation each team will be
explaining their topic to the whole class.

Add a file `"/research/authors.json"`

```json5
{
  "creators": [
    "NAME1@est.fib.upc.edu",
    "NAME2@est.fib.upc.edu",
    "NAME3@est.fib.upc.edu"
  ],
  "validators": [
    "NAME4@est.fib.upc.edu",
    "NAME5@est.fib.upc.edu",
  ]
}
```

The teacher will evaluate the tutorials based on the documentation, presentation and the feedback offered by the
students evaluating. Once all tutorials evaluated, they will be included in this repository to make them available for
everyone.

**Grade**:

- tutorial documentation
- presentation *(use a PDF that can be attached in the repo)* and explanations
- feedback offered by the two teams following the tutorial
